# Love-Nature-website-

The purpose of building this website was to test my coding skills on the basics of HTML, SCSS and a little bit of Javascript.
I chose a basic WordPress website from the Startertemplates library and I started with building the homepage.
It turned out quiet well if I may say so myself...
